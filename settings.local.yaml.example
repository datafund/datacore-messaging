# Messaging module settings
# Copy to settings.local.yaml and configure

identity:
  name: yourname                   # Your username (required)
  # Your Claude agent will connect as: yourname-claude

messaging:
  default_space: 1-team            # Space for message inboxes (e.g., 1-datafund)

  # Users allowed to message YOUR Claude agent (@yourname-claude)
  # Others get auto-reply without involving the LLM
  claude_whitelist:
    - gregor                       # @gregor can message @yourname-claude
    - crt                          # @crt can message @yourname-claude
    # Leave empty [] to allow everyone, or omit to disable whitelist

  relay:
    secret: "your-team-shared-secret"    # Same secret for all team members

    # Choose your relay URL based on deployment:
    # url: "ws://localhost:8080/ws"                           # Local testing
    # url: "ws://192.168.1.100:8080/ws"                       # LAN server (no SSL)
    # url: "ws://relay.internal.company.com:8080/ws"          # Internal server (no SSL)
    url: "wss://datacore-messaging-relay.datafund.io/ws"      # Public relay (with SSL)

# Routing:
#   @claude        → automatically routes to @<sender>-claude (your own Claude)
#   @gregor-claude → goes to Gregor's Claude (if you're whitelisted)
#
# User naming convention:
#   @yourname       - Your human identity (GUI window)
#   @yourname-claude - Your personal Claude agent
#
# Example:
#   @tex           - Tex's GUI window
#   @tex-claude    - Tex's Claude Code session
#   @gregor        - Gregor's GUI window
#   @gregor-claude - Gregor's Claude Code session
